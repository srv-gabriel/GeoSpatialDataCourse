    "\n",
    "<p>The Earth Engine API has its own data catalog and Google is doing a great job on providing it in an easy to use and free way. You can find all the data available for Earth Engine in this <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets\">link</a>. In this series we will be working mainly with raw data, e.g. bands of satellite imagery, as our goal is to apply some Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques using Remote Sensing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the EE's data catalog we can find imagery from Landsat series (1, 4, 5, 7 and 8), sentinel series (1, 2, 3 and 5P), MODIS (too many to put here), Planet labs SkySat and NAIP. Those are very precious data that we will be exploring in details set-by-set. It's very easy to acquire the data using EE, you just need to access the data catalog, search for the dataset you want to use, and in the page of this dataset there will be an Id similar to this: LANDSAT/LC08/C01/T1. Then, you just need to paste it into the ee.ImageCollection() function, that we will be seing in the folling cells.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Now we will be taking a closer look at Landsat imagery, more specificly at Landsat-8 imagery. In the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/landsat-8\">Landsat-8 section</a> we find 3 options: Surface Reflectance, Top of Atmosphere and Raw Images. We will understand better each of these sections further, for now let's just say that there are raw images with a lot of noise which need some preprocessing, and top of atmosphere and surface reflectance are images after some preprocessing methods are applied. In this notebook, we will visualize the raw images that have the ID LANDSAT/LC08/C01/T1. This ID is from a ImageCollection, a class that its object contains many images and methods to filter and process those images.\n",
    "    \n",
    "In this catalog there are some Feature Collections also. We can find a lot of them with different purposes and we will be using some of them in this series. As an example we gonna use the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/USDOS_LSIB_SIMPLE_2017\">Large Scale International Boundary Polygons, Simplified (LSIB)</a> FeatureCollection to filter images that cover only a country's boundaries. In the data catalog you can find the table schema to understand better how to use the FeatureCollection. Similar to ImageCollection, FeatureCollection is a class that its object has many features, and those features can be countries boundaries, states boundaries, U.S terrestrial and marine protected areas boundaries, global land ice measurements, and many more.\n",
    "    \n",
    "So what we gonna do in the next cells is load images from Landsat-8 that cover Brazil's territory. Those images will be a 1-year composite, i.e. we select an image collection from a 1-year time range and select the median value for each pixel, generating only one image. Now let's go to the code\n",

    "However, we just want to get Brazil's boundaries and the above cell returned to us boundaries from the whole world. Now what we have to do is use a filter to get what we want. An object of the FeatureCollection class has a method called filter, which receives a filter from the Filter class, and this filter filters based on the metadata of the FeatureCollection object. So we are using the ee.Filter.eq() function that filters to metadata equal to the given value (eq stands for equal). 'country_na' and 'Brazil' are atributes of the FeatureCollection table schema, 'country_na' stands for Country Name, and 'Brazil' stands for the name of the country that we want to get the boundaries, so for filtering we have to first select the way we want to access it, in this case by country name and then we have to select the country that we want.
