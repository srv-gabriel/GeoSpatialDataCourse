# GeoSpatialDataCourse

This repository has the goal to create some free introductory content for geospatial data analysis and remote sensing. As I'm also learning using <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/spatial-data-analysis-with-earth-engine-python-api/">this</a> course, I will upload new content as I learn it and try to explain the best way I can.

Feel free to send me a message, comment and suggestion to improve the content.

Sequence to follow:

<ul>
	<li>Install_EE.ipynb:
		Notebook to get familiar with the libraries we will be using,
		install them and visualize what they can do.
	</li>
	<li>Load_landsat_image.ipynb:
		Start working with satellite imagery, understand how the data is acquired,
		understand the pre-processing and the Landsat-8 specifications <br>
	</li>
</ul>
