# GeoSpatialDataCourse

This repository has the goal to create some free introductory content for geospatial data analysis and remote sensing. As I'm also learning using <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/spatial-data-analysis-with-earth-engine-python-api/">this</a> course, I will upload new content as I learn it and try to explain the best way I can.

Feel free to send me a message, comment and suggestion to improve the content.
